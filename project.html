    <h1>Welcome to Part 9: Your JavaScript Level One Project</h1>

    <p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions
    to normal users, but you secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting your website
    will be asked a series of questions, only the Spy will be ab;e to give specific answers
    you expect. If all questions are asnwered correctly, you will post a secret message in console for the Spy to read!</p>

    <p>Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name</li>
      <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30)</li>
      <li>The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall</li>
      <li>The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "Y"</li>

      <p>A Spy with the following information should see your secret message:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Jose Johnson</li>
        <li>26 years old</li>
        <li>175 cm tall</li>
